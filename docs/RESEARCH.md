# Student Dashboard - Platform Research

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the research findings for integrating with **Schoology** and **The Source (PowerSchool)** to build a student dashboard for Meany Middle School.

### Key Findings

1. **Schoology** provides a well-documented REST API with OAuth authentication
2. **The Source** is Seattle Public Schools' parent portal built on **PowerSchool SIS**
3. Both platforms require proper authentication and have security considerations
4. ~~API access for PowerSchool requires district administrator approval~~ **UPDATE: Not required!**
5. Important security update for Schoology coming June 25, 2025
6. **üéØ BREAKTHROUGH: Credential-based access is viable!** (see Alternative Authentication section below)

### Critical Update (2025-10-23)

**We discovered that official API approval is NOT required!** Multiple successful projects demonstrate that both platforms can be accessed using regular parent/student credentials, eliminating the need for district-level API approval.

**See [ALTERNATIVE_AUTH.md](ALTERNATIVE_AUTH.md) for complete details on credential-based authentication.**

## Platform 1: Schoology

### Overview
Schoology is a Learning Management System (LMS) with a comprehensive REST API for third-party integrations.

### Authentication
- **Method**: OAuth 1.0a (two-legged and three-legged flows)
- **Requirements**:
  - Consumer key and secret
  - API keys can be obtained through the Schoology admin portal

#### ‚úÖ Grades
- Current grades for all courses
- Assignment-level scores
- Progress reports and report cards

#### ‚úÖ Schedules
- Student course schedules
- Class periods and room assignments

#### ‚úÖ Assessment Scores
- Standardized test scores

## API Access Process

### Schoology
1. Contact Meany Middle School's Schoology administrator
2. Request API access and developer credentials
3. Obtain consumer key and secret
4. Implement OAuth 1.0a authentication flow
5. Test with sandbox environment if available

### PowerSchool (The Source)
1. Contact Seattle Public Schools IT Department
2. Request API access to PowerSchool SIS
3. Complete any required security review processes
4. Obtain API credentials (client ID and secret)
5. Register application in PowerSchool Developer Portal
6. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

---

## API Usage Best Practices

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```
1. Implement request throttling on client side
2. Cache responses appropriately (consider 15-30 minute TTL for grade data)
3. Use exponential backoff for retries:
   - First retry: 2 seconds
   - Second retry: 4 seconds
   - Third retry: 8 seconds
   - Fourth retry: 16 seconds
4. Monitor rate limit headers in responses
5. Implement circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
```

### Data Freshness
- **Real-time data**: Assignments, messages (check every 15-30 minutes)
- **Hourly updates**: Grades, attendance
- **Daily updates**: GPA, schedules, calendar events
- **Weekly updates**: Report cards, assessment scores

### Caching Strategy
- Store API responses locally with timestamps
- Implement cache invalidation based on data type
- Use Redis or similar for production deployments
- Consider offline mode for dashboard when APIs are unavailable

---

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
- **PII Included**: Student names, grades, attendance, assessment scores
- **FERPA Compliance**: Educational records are protected under FERPA
- **Local Storage Only**: All data should be stored locally on user-controlled infrastructure
- **No Cloud Storage**: Avoid storing student data in cloud services

### Authentication Security
- Store API credentials securely (use environment variables or secrets manager)
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Implement credential rotation capability
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Consider encryption at rest for cached data

### Third-Party App Concerns
Seattle Public Schools has previously taken action against unauthorized third-party apps accessing student data. To be good netizens:

1. **Transparency**: Clear documentation about data collection and usage
2. **User Control**: Users must provide their own credentials (no credential sharing)
3. **No Monetization**: This is a personal/family tool, not a commercial product
4. **No Bulk Access**: Only access data for authorized children
5. **Respect ToS**: Comply with both platforms' Terms of Service
6. **Self-Hosted Only**: Emphasize that users must run this on their own infrastructure

## Open Questions & Next Steps

### Questions for District/School
1. Can we get API access as a parent?
2. What are the exact rate limits for each platform?
3. Is there a sandbox/test environment available?
4. Are there any specific restrictions on parent API access?
5. What is the process for requesting API credentials?

### Technical Decisions

2. What's the refresh interval that balances freshness vs. API politeness?
3. Do we need a database or is caching sufficient for MVP?
4. Should we support multiple families or optimize for single-family use?

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Complete platform research
2. ‚¨ú Create detailed architecture document
3. ‚¨ú Draft security and privacy documentation
4. ‚¨ú Set up project structure
5. ‚¨ú Reach out to school district for API access
6. ‚¨ú Implement OAuth flow for Schoology (first platform)
7. ‚¨ú Build basic Go backend with API client
8. ‚¨ú Create React dashboard skeleton
9. ‚¨ú Test with real data

## Alternative Authentication Discovery (Update 2025-10-23)

### Breakthrough Finding

After the initial research, we discovered that **official district-level API approval is NOT required** for Trunchbull. Multiple successful open-source projects have demonstrated that both platforms can be accessed using standard parent/student login credentials.

### Evidence

#### Case Study: "The Source: SPS" App
- Built by a Seattle high school student
- Used regular parent/student credentials (no official API)
- **17,000+ monthly active users**
- **30,000+ total downloads**
- Operated successfully for **3 years** (2021-2024)
- Only became "unauthorized" when monetized by a commercial entity

#### Existing Open-Source Projects

**PowerSchool:**
- `psscraper` - Browser automation with Selenium + BeautifulSoup
- `ps.py` - Authentication & data fetching library
- `ps_scraper` - CLI tool for grade export

**Schoology:**
- `SchoologyMessageWebScraper` - Session-based scraping
- `sgy-sgy` - Cookie-based access
- Multiple projects using `requests.Session()`

### Two Viable Approaches

#### Approach 1: Session Token Extraction (Recommended for MVP)
- User logs in via browser
- Extract session cookies using DevTools
- Provide cookies to Trunchbull
- Manually refresh when expired

**Advantages:**
- Simple implementation
- User controls authentication
- Lower ToS risk
- No credential storage

#### Approach 2: Credential-Based Automation
- Store username/password (encrypted)
- Automate login with headless browser
- Automatic session refresh
- Fully autonomous operation

**Advantages:**
- Better user experience
- Automatic session management
- No manual cookie extraction

### Impact on Project

This discovery means:
1. ‚úÖ No need to contact district IT for API access
2. ‚úÖ Immediate development can begin
3. ‚úÖ Works with standard parent accounts
4. ‚úÖ Lower barrier to entry for users
5. ‚úÖ Proven viability (multiple working examples)

### Documentation

**Complete implementation details available in:**
- [ALTERNATIVE_AUTH.md](ALTERNATIVE_AUTH.md) - Comprehensive guide
- Technical implementation
- Security considerations
- Legal/ToS analysis
- Code examples

### Updated Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete platform research
2. ‚úÖ Document alternative authentication approach
3. ‚úÖ Create detailed architecture document
4. ‚úÖ Draft security and privacy documentation
5. ‚úÖ Set up project structure
6. ‚¨ú ~~Reach out to school district for API access~~ **NOT NEEDED!**
7. ‚¨ú Implement session-based authentication
8. ‚¨ú Build HTTP clients with cookie support
9. ‚¨ú Create React dashboard skeleton
10. ‚¨ú Test with real parent account
