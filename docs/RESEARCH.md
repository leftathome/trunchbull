## Platform 1: Schoology

### Overview
Schoology is a Learning Management System (LMS) with a comprehensive REST API for third-party integrations.

### Authentication
- **Method**: OAuth 1.0a (two-legged and three-legged flows)
- **Requirements**:
  - Consumer key and secret
  - API keys can be obtained through the Schoology admin portal
- **Security Update (June 25, 2025)**: Personal API keys will no longer be able to access other users' data

### Available API Endpoints

- **Endpoint**: `/sections/{section_id}/assignments`
- **Capabilities**:
  - List all assignments for a section
  - Get assignment details including due dates
  - Check completion status
  - View attachments and tags
- **Documentation**: developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/rest-api-v1/assignment/

#### ✅ Grades
- **Endpoint**: `/sections/{section_id}/grades`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Get grades by assignment_id or enrollment_id
  - Filter by grading period

#### ✅ Parent-Child Associations
- **Endpoint**: `/users/{user_id}/parents` and `/users/{user_id}/children`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Link parent and child accounts
  - Access child data through parent credentials
- **Documentation**: developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/rest-api-v1/user/

### Rate Limits

### Authentication
- **Method**: OAuth 2.0
- **Requirements**:
  - Application registration with PowerSchool
  - API key and secret
  - **District administrator approval required**
- **Access**: Permission must be granted by system admins at the district level

### Available API Endpoints

#### ✅ Attendance

- Historical attendance data

#### ✅ Grades
- Current grades for all courses
- Assignment-level scores
- Progress reports and report cards

#### ✅ Schedules
- Student course schedules
- Class periods and room assignments

#### ✅ Assessment Scores
- Standardized test scores
- District assessments

#### ⚠️ GPA
- Typically available through PowerSchool
- May require specific API endpoints (needs verification with district)

#### ⚠️ Calendar / Events
- School events and days off
- District calendar
- **Note**: Availability depends on district configuration

### Rate Limits
- **Enforced**: Yes
- **Error Code**: 429 Too Many Requests
- **Header**: `Retry-After` header indicates wait time in seconds
- **Best Practice**: Implement exponential backoff and request throttling

### Developer Resources
- **Documentation**: support.powerschool.com/developer (requires PowerSchool account)
- **Access Request**: Must contact Seattle Public Schools IT department
- **Community**: PowerSchool Community forums (help.powerschool.com)

### Important Security Note
PowerSchool experienced a significant data breach in January 2025. Security and data handling are critical considerations for any integration.

| GPA calculation | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Likely available | May need to calculate from grades |
| School events / days off | ✅ Course events | ✅ District calendar | Combine both sources |
| Teacher messages | ✅ Full support | ⚠️ Needs verification | Schoology has messaging API |
| Parent authentication | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | Both support parent accounts |

**Legend:**
- ✅ Full support confirmed
- ⚠️ Partial support or needs verification

## API Access Process

### Schoology
1. Contact Meany Middle School's Schoology administrator
2. Request API access and developer credentials
3. Obtain consumer key and secret
4. Implement OAuth 1.0a authentication flow
5. Test with sandbox environment if available

### PowerSchool (The Source)
1. Contact Seattle Public Schools IT Department
2. Request API access to PowerSchool SIS
3. Complete any required security review processes
4. Obtain API credentials (client ID and secret)
5. Register application in PowerSchool Developer Portal
6. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

---

## API Usage Best Practices

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```
1. Implement request throttling on client side
2. Cache responses appropriately (consider 15-30 minute TTL for grade data)
3. Use exponential backoff for retries:
   - First retry: 2 seconds
   - Second retry: 4 seconds
   - Third retry: 8 seconds
   - Fourth retry: 16 seconds
4. Monitor rate limit headers in responses
5. Implement circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
```

### Data Freshness
- **Real-time data**: Assignments, messages (check every 15-30 minutes)
- **Hourly updates**: Grades, attendance
- **Daily updates**: GPA, schedules, calendar events
- **Weekly updates**: Report cards, assessment scores

### Caching Strategy
- Store API responses locally with timestamps
- Implement cache invalidation based on data type
- Use Redis or similar for production deployments
- Consider offline mode for dashboard when APIs are unavailable

---

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
- **PII Included**: Student names, grades, attendance, assessment scores
- **FERPA Compliance**: Educational records are protected under FERPA
- **Local Storage Only**: All data should be stored locally on user-controlled infrastructure
- **No Cloud Storage**: Avoid storing student data in cloud services

### Authentication Security
- Store API credentials securely (use environment variables or secrets manager)
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Implement credential rotation capability
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Consider encryption at rest for cached data

### Third-Party App Concerns
Seattle Public Schools has previously taken action against unauthorized third-party apps accessing student data. To be good netizens:

1. **Transparency**: Clear documentation about data collection and usage
2. **User Control**: Users must provide their own credentials (no credential sharing)
3. **No Monetization**: This is a personal/family tool, not a commercial product
4. **No Bulk Access**: Only access data for authorized children
5. **Respect ToS**: Comply with both platforms' Terms of Service
6. **Self-Hosted Only**: Emphasize that users must run this on their own infrastructure

## Open Questions & Next Steps

### Questions for District/School
1. Can we get API access as a parent?
2. What are the exact rate limits for each platform?
3. Is there a sandbox/test environment available?
4. Are there any specific restrictions on parent API access?
5. What is the process for requesting API credentials?

### Technical Decisions
1. Should we implement our own GPA calculation or rely on platform data?
2. What's the refresh interval that balances freshness vs. API politeness?
3. Do we need a database or is caching sufficient for MVP?
4. Should we support multiple families or optimize for single-family use?

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete platform research
2. ⬜ Create detailed architecture document
3. ⬜ Draft security and privacy documentation
4. ⬜ Set up project structure
5. ⬜ Reach out to school district for API access
6. ⬜ Implement OAuth flow for Schoology (first platform)
7. ⬜ Build basic Go backend with API client
8. ⬜ Create React dashboard skeleton
9. ⬜ Test with real data
